# Book SQL

This repository was developed by **Eymen Akbulut** as part of learning computing with python.
This version is the **local-saving** variant of one of my previous projects:  
[Books](https://github.com/EymenAkb/Books/blob/main/books.py).

## Description

This program is a basic console-based library program that allows you to:

- `Add books` to your library,
- `List books` from your library,
- `Search books` in your library,
- `Delete books` from your library,
- `Configure books` in your library.

The purpose of this project is practice and apply the following Python concepts:

1 - Working with `Lists`, `dicts` (dictionaries) and other variable types.
2 - Defining functions using `def` and making function calls.
3 - Basic error handling using `try` / `except`.
4 - `While` loops and user interaction handling.
5 - One lined `if / else` statements.
6 - Using the `sqlite3` library to store data **locally**.

## Required libraries

This version of the project requires two built_in python libraries:

1 - `time`: Used for better user interactions.
2 - `sqlite3`: Used for saving your library in your device locally.

No external installations are necessary.

## Usage

Run the program in your terminal or command prompt:  
```bash
python book_sql.py
```
**The program will guide you** through all operations via the console.

## Note

This program saves your library in your device **Locally**.
**No internet connection is required.
