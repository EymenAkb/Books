# Books

This repository was developed by **Eymen Akbulut** as part of learning Computing with Python.

## Description

This program is a basic console-based library program that allows you to:

- `Add books` to your library,
- `List books` from your library,
- `Search books` from your library,
- `Delete books` from your library,
- `Configure books` from your library.

The purpose of the project is learning conditions mentioned below:

1 - `Lists`, `dicts` (dictionaries) and other variable types.
2 - Defining functions using `def` and making function calls.
3 - Basic error handling using `try` / `except`.
4 - `While` loops and user interaction handling.
5 - One lined `if / else` statements.

## Required Libraries

This version uses only one built-in Python library:

- `time`: Used to add small pauses, making the interaction smoother and easier to follow.

## Usage

When you start the program, **the program will guide you** through the process.

# Note

This program **does not** save your library on your device.
